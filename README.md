# Eventfol

Eventfol is here to manage your events! Written in Java following a MVC pattern this application includes a complete user interface that makes it easy to create, edit, delete events. These functionalities are supported by MariaDB, manipulated with the built-in java-mysql-connector library. Additionally, the user may notify relevant contacts of upcoming events by interfacing with the JavaMail API.
